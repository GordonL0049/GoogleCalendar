This is an App Inventor extension for Google Calendar. (This took me :calendar: 3 weeks to make. Hope it saved some of your time!)

Here is the first App Inventor extension for Google Calendars, with 70+ blocks. 

Google Calendars is a complicated tool for App Inventor, unlike Google Drive, and you need to set up things like permissions for Apps Script and calendar IDs. It also has 5 different permissions, unlike 4 in Google Drive, but fear not, I'll walk you through the whole process. It will only take around 5 to 10 minutes to implement this into your project.

We all know that there was a tutorial about Google Calendars at [the old forum](https://groups.google.com/g/app-inventor-developers-library/c/x4GBw8wVI0I/m/U5gU_TxwsUoJ), but it is 8 years old, Google has changed, and of course, we need a new method.

First, you have to obtain a few things - a calendar ID and a Google Apps Script. Go to the **:bookmark_tabs: Instructions before using** section after the documentation.
